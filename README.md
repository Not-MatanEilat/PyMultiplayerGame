# Multiplayer game
This is a prototype multiplayer game I made using Python (Pygame) for the client and C# for the server

This was made as a test and not be an actual game

The game supports movements between clients that updates for everyone and connection and disconnection of players

## How to run
in order to run the game you'll need python installed on your computer with the Pygame and Marshmallow-dataclass libraries

Libraries can be installed by the following commands once python is installed:
```
pip install pygame
pip install marshmallow-dataclass
```

Afterwards open the GameServer solution and build the application.

After that all is left is to run the client and connect to the game!
